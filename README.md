# -CNN-based-Potato-Disease-Diagnosis
### Overview:

This project focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify potato plants into three categories: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight.

### Goals:

1.  Develop an accurate model for potato disease classification.
2.  Implemented CNN architecture to learn features from potato plant images.
3.  Classified images into Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight categories.

### Dataset:

-   Utilized a labeled dataset consisting of images of potato plants affected by different diseases and healthy plants.
-   Dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Model Architecture:

-   Designed a CNN architecture for image classification.
-   Utilized convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers for feature extraction and classification.
-   Employed softmax activation for multi-class classification.

### Data Preprocessing:

-   Resized images to a standard size.
-   Applied normalization to bring pixel values into a consistent range.
-   Implemented data augmentation to increase model robustness.

### Training:

-   Trained the model using the training dataset.
-   Used Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

### Evaluation:

-   Assessed the model's performance on a separate testing dataset.

## Results:

-   Achieved high accuracy in classifying potato diseases.
- project's comprehensive visualizations showcase the training accuracy, validation accuracy, and training loss,validation loss providing a clear overview of the model's learning
